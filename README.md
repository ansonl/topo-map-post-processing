# 3D G-code Map Feature Modifier (MFM)

Add colored [isolines (contour lines/elevation lines)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contour_line) and recolor [elevation ranges](https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/map/styles-and-symbols/working-with-color-ramps.htm) to [3D printable map models](https://ansonliu.com/maps/). **3D G-code Map Feature Modifier (MFM)** is a G-code Post Processor made for 3D topo map models but any 3D model can be recolored with 2 additional colors.

[Download the latest version of MFM](https://github.com/ansonl/mfm/releases)!

MFM adds additional features to the model by post processing sliced [3D printer G-code](https://marlinfw.org/meta/gcode/). 3D models and printing g-code can be recolored at either layer or individual feature/line level granularity.

- **Feature/Line Type Scoping** - Recoloring can be set to only affect specific printing feature/line types. *Only want to recolor top surfaces or walls at certain heights? Do it with MFM!*

- **G-code Feature Print Order Optimization** - Printed features are rearranged for faster, more consistent prints. Nozzle pressure is maintained and the number of toolchanges is decreased.

- **Wipe/Coasting Compensation** - Existing Wipe/Coasting flow compensation generated by the slicer is retained even when g-code features are relocated.

- **Prime Tower Compatible** - Existing Prime Towers are reused for optimal filament flow and color flushing. *No prime tower or large prime tower? I don't judge. Both configurations are supported.*

- **Slicer Compatibility** - Tested to be compatible with PrusaSlicer and Bambu Studio.

## Current G-code flavors supported

- Marlin 2 ([PrusaSlicer](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer)/[Bambu Studio](https://github.com/bambulab/BambuStudio))

Your slicer **must generate g-code with [Relative Extrusion](https://www.ideamaker.io/dictionaryDetail.html?name=Relative%20Extrusion&category_name=Printer%20Settings)**. PrusaSlicer and Bambu Studio default to relative extrusion. Cura defaults to absolute extrusion and relative extrusion must be explicitly enabled.

| Slicer | Tested Version |
| --- | --- |
| PrusaSlicer | 2.7.1 |
| Bambu Studio | 1.8.2.56 |
| Cura | Looking for testers |

If you would like support for your printer or slicer G-code flavor to be added, please open an issue and if you are able to test the G-code on your printer.

## Getting Started

Set up your slicer and printer for MFM by following the steps on each page below:

1. [Slicer Setup](slicer-setup.md)

2. [Configuration](configuration-setup.md)

3. [Minimal Toolchange G-code](minimal-toolchange-gcode.md)

After following all three above setup pages, download the [latest release of MFM](https://github.com/ansonl/mfm/releases) and run `MFM.exe` to start MFM.

1. Select the import G-code file that was saved from your slicer

2. Select the configuration JSON file that you customized.

3. Select the toolchange G-code file for your printer.

4. Check if the export G-code file location looks right

5. Press *Post Process*

> If a release of MFM has not been built for your OS, you can [download](https://github.com/ansonl/mfm/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) this repo, navigate to it in the command line and run `python src/gui.py`.

## Frequent Issues

| 🚧 Issue | Solution |
| --- | --- |
| How do I convert a 3D model into G-code for printing? | After importing and slicing your model in a slicer software, export the 3D printer commands as [ASCII] G-code. MFM can be process and recolor this saved G-code file. |
| How do I printer my G-code file? | Put the G-code file exported by MFM on an SD card or transfer the G-code file to your printer over the network. Bambu printer users can use [FTPS](https://forum.bambulab.com/t/we-can-now-connect-to-ftp-on-the-p1-and-a1-series/6464) for wireless transfer. |
| MFM did not add or change any colors. | Setup your slicer for MFM through [Slicer Setup](slicer-setup.md) |
| How can MFM recoloring be customized? | Read [Configuration](configuration-setup.md) for details. |
| How can MFM be used with a material other than PLA and customized toolchange? | See [Minimal Toolchange G-code](minimal-toolchange-gcode.md) on recommendations on how to setup your own toolchange. I may add an option to set toolchange temperatures based on material in the future. Open an issue with your use cases. |
| Incorrect color was printed even though previewing the exported G-code in the slicer shows the correct color slots being used. | Assign a different filament to each slot in the Bambu AMS. Every slot with a different color **must have a different color assigned** in AMS. Otherwise Bambu AMS [Autoswitch](https://forum.bambulab.com/t/automatic-material-switch-over/4189) feature may try to use a single slot's filament for a shared material and color between multiple slots. |
| Mixed OS line endings in the same file will lead to G-code errors. MFM tries to auto detect the line ending used with first line ending found. | Select the correct line ending of your G-code instead of auto detect. Either convert the entire G-code file with Unix line endings to Windows line endings before post processing or generate the G-code on Windows. [Python on Windows does not handle Unix line endings correctly.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15934950/python-file-tell-giving-strange-numbers) |
| Only one isoline interval and/or colored elevation range can be set. | Only one of each is exposed at the moment. The implementation could support more in the future if there is a use case. |
| Support and Bridge features are not explicitly prioritized to pprint first.  | I could prioritize printing certain features first in the future. Open an issue with your use cases for this. |

## Bug Reports

Open an issue on Github. Please note the OS, Slicer, printer, and provide the 3D model, MFM configuration JSON, before/after G-code, and any console logs.
